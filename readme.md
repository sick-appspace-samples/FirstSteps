## FirstSteps

Introduction to the possibilities of the Profile API

### Description

This Sample shows how to use the basic algorithms of the Profile API. It is
related to the according tutorial and shows for example how to calculate metadata,
use the derivatives or smooth data.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the profiles after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
